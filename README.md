## Hi there, Folks! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Italian M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering, specialized in
Technologies for Electronics.

I graduated in July 2024 discussing a
[Thesis](https://github.com/andriluca/Thesis/blob/main/Latex/Thesis.pdf)
about a morphometric model of premature neonatal lungs (generated by a
custom Chaste [User
Project](https://github.com/andriluca/NewbornAirwayGeneration)) the
relative mechanical simulations performed on it.

I want to thank Techres Lab for allowing me to work on this Project.
